# Hodge Conjecture Research

This directory supports the active [Hodge Conjecture Research Spine](../projects/hodge-conjecture.md).

## Start here

1. [`../projects/hodge-conjecture.md`](../projects/hodge-conjecture.md) — canonical human-readable research state and target contract.
2. [`STRUCTURAL_SUPPORTS.md`](docs/STRUCTURAL_SUPPORTS.md) — mathematical and research footing stack.
3. [`RESEARCH_INTEGRATION_MAP.md`](docs/RESEARCH_INTEGRATION_MAP.md) — typed imports from the broader research corpus.
4. [`CONSCIENCE64_COOPERATION.md`](docs/CONSCIENCE64_COOPERATION.md) — companion/reflow/provenance contract.
5. [`claim_matrix.json`](claim_matrix.json) — machine-readable live claim and bridge ledger.
6. [`HODGE_COMPASS_API.md`](docs/HODGE_COMPASS_API.md) — fast provenance/query API connection; method-only with evidence transfer denied by default.
7. [`W114_SIGN_NORMALIZATION_CORRECTION_2026-09-25.md`](docs/W114_SIGN_NORMALIZATION_CORRECTION_2026-09-25.md) — forward correction separating the full order-114 Kummer carrier from the Aoki/Yamamoto quadratic gap sign.

## Core target

For smooth projective complex `X` and codimension `p`:

```text
A_alg(X,p) = image(CH^p(X)_Q -> H^(2p)(X,Q))
H_Hodge(X,p) = H^(2p)(X,Q) ∩ H^(p,p)(X)
```

The research goal is to understand and attack the equality

```text
A_alg(X,p) = H_Hodge(X,p).
```

## Current operational frontier

```text
known algebraic cycles
-> exact cycle classes
-> exact span / lattice information
-> rational Hodge target
-> optional certified symmetry decomposition
-> verified missing sector
-> targeted algebraic construction
-> independent check
-> claim ceiling
```

The working hypothesis is methodological: P-vs-NP-style range avoidance, symmetry-promise checks, sharing-aware rank accounting, and counterprobe discipline may make the cycle-discovery search more discriminating. This is not a reduction between the two open problems.

## Calibration ladder

```text
P^2
-> P^1 x P^1
-> abelian surface
-> Kummer K3
-> Fermat quartic K3
-> smooth cubic fourfold calibration
-> selected unresolved families/codimensions
```

## Hard boundaries

```text
CALIBRATION_RESULT != OPEN_PROBLEM_RESULT
FINITE_VERIFICATION != UNIVERSALITY
SAME_HODGE_DIAMOND != SAME_ALGEBRAIC_CYCLE_STRUCTURE
CYCLE_COUNT != CYCLE_CLASS_RANK
SYMMETRY != USEFUL_QUOTIENT
COMPLEX_(p,p) != RATIONAL_HODGE_CLASS
CONSCIENCE64_RETRIEVAL != INDEPENDENT_EVIDENCE
```

## Claim ceiling

The Hodge conjecture is not established by the current project. The directory is a research framework, evidence ledger, calibration suite, and targeted search program.
