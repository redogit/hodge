# Hodge Span Lab

An exact rational linear-algebra aid for the existing
[Conscience64 Hodge research spine](https://github.com/redogit/conscience64/tree/b6da9fcc8e56019b27656f7e244a8b1f763ed15c/research/hodge).
It helps ask: which supplied target directions are outside the span of supplied cycle-class vectors?
It does not compute those classes from equations or establish that any input is a Hodge class.

## Use it

Python 3.10+, standard library only. From the repository root:

```sh
python "Hodge Span Lab/span.py" "Hodge Span Lab/example.json"
python "Hodge Span Lab/bridge.py" "Hodge Span Lab/bridge_calibration.json"
python -m unittest discover -s "Hodge Span Lab" -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

Copy the synthetic example locally. Declare a common ordered basis and supply rows
as exact integers or rational strings such as `"1/3"`. JSON floating-point numbers
are rejected. Maximum ambient dimension is 32; each list permits 64 vectors;
input scalars are limited to 256 bits. The CLI rejects files exceeding 1 MB.
These bounds limit input, not a guarantee of runtime or intermediate expression size.

The example has three candidate rows but rank two. One target direction is missing.
The returned covector pairs to zero with every supplied cycle vector but not with
the missing target. Anyone can check those dot products without trusting the elimination routine.
Zero/duplicate vectors are allowed and do not increase rank. An empty target list
is vacuously contained and is not evidence of geometric completeness.

## Deformation candidate bridge

`bridge.py` is the bounded issue-43 adapter. It preserves the complete ordered S'1
action chronology, separately compresses that chronology to the exact signed
`[xw, yw, zw]` one-degree count vector, applies only a declared exact rational
matrix into the Hodge Span Lab basis, and tests exactly one derived candidate
against the supplied cycle-vector span.

The committed synthetic calibration has one `zw +1°` action. Its compressed
signature is `[0,0,1]`; the declared synthetic identity map therefore produces
candidate `[0,0,1]`. Against the supplied calibration rows `[1,0,0]`, `[2,0,0]`,
and `[0,1,0]`, the exact span calculation reports that candidate outside their
rational span and returns a separating covector. This is a property of the declared
synthetic coordinates only.

The bridge carrier retains source/map/template hashes and the full chronology.
The compressed signature is explicitly marked
`signed-plane-count-only-not-full-deformation-equivalence`: two differently ordered
rotation histories can have the same count vector and the same derived candidate
without being the same deformation. The candidate derivation therefore depends on
the compressed signature only, while provenance preserves the distinction between
its source histories.

Evidence boundaries are strict:

- `real 4D != complex dimension 4`;
- `compressed signature equality != full deformation equivalence`;
- `visual/geometric deformation != algebraic cycle`;
- `candidate direction != Hodge class`;
- `span/rank/separation software result != proof of algebraicity or completeness`;
- the Hodge conjecture remains open.

If an exact basis-matched algebraic map cannot be written, the bridge fails closed.
It does not infer or invent one from visual similarity.

## Before a result can support geometry

Keep a separate record of the variety and smooth/projective hypotheses, codimension,
coefficient field, basis source, construction and algebraicity of each cycle,
class-map calculation, completeness of the rational Hodge target, and exact source revisions.
This tool does not authenticate any of those records. It diagnoses supplied coordinates only.
Target rank is not inferred from a complex Hodge number or a Hodge diamond.

The calculation is over the rationals, not an integral lattice. For example,
`[1,0]` belongs to the rational span of `[2,0]`; that does not show integral generation.
Containment of supplied targets does not show that the targets exhaust the true Hodge space.
A missing supplied direction means a construction task remains **conditional on valid input geometry**;
it is not a counterexample to the Hodge conjecture.

## Research use

1. Start with authenticated exact classes from a calibration or selected family.
2. Inspect repeated/dependent candidate rows before generating more cycles.
3. Check returned separating covectors independently.
4. Try a construction aimed at a detected direction; retain the failed attempt too.
5. Rerun with new input and preserve both input hashes. A changed basis or target invalidates stale comparisons.

This makes the public spine's `CYCLE_COUNT != CYCLE_CLASS_RANK` distinction executable.
It does not settle auxiliary-factor cancellation, an intersection calculation,
join nonvanishing or any theorem dependency. No P-versus-NP reduction is proposed.

## Verification

Tests include all 81 two-by-two integer matrices with entries in {-1,0,1}, using an
independent determinant rank oracle, and direct dot-product checks for every returned
separator in that family. Bridge tests cover exact rational mapping, basis mismatch,
invalid deformation moves, deterministic provenance hashing, chronology-preserving
compression, compression-loss boundaries, one-target isolation, and the executable
calibration. This is bounded software verification, not independent geometric replication.
Recorded span execution is under `evidence/hodge-span-001/`.
