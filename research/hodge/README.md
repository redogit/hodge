# Hodge Conjecture Research

This directory supports the active [Hodge Conjecture Research Spine](../projects/hodge-conjecture.md).

## Start here

1. [`../projects/hodge-conjecture.md`](../projects/hodge-conjecture.md) — canonical human-readable research state and target contract.
2. [`STRUCTURAL_SUPPORTS.md`](STRUCTURAL_SUPPORTS.md) — mathematical and research footing stack.
3. [`RESEARCH_INTEGRATION_MAP.md`](RESEARCH_INTEGRATION_MAP.md) — typed imports from the broader research corpus.
4. [`CONSCIENCE64_COOPERATION.md`](CONSCIENCE64_COOPERATION.md) — companion/reflow/provenance contract.
5. [`claim_matrix.json`](claim_matrix.json) — machine-readable live claim and bridge ledger.
6. [`HODGE_COMPASS_API.md`](HODGE_COMPASS_API.md) — fast provenance/query API connection; method-only with evidence transfer denied by default.
7. [`W114_SIGN_NORMALIZATION_CORRECTION_2026-09-25.md`](W114_SIGN_NORMALIZATION_CORRECTION_2026-09-25.md) — forward correction separating the full order-114 Kummer carrier from the Aoki/Yamamoto quadratic gap sign.
8. [`conformance/README.md`](conformance/README.md) — v0.1 command/event kernel conformance harness with frozen E001–E010 authority, replay, exact-backend, BRL, Fermat, visualization, correspondence, recovery, parallelism, and parser tests.

## Core target

For smooth projective complex `X` and codimension `p`:

```text
A_alg(X,p) = image(CH^p(X)_Q -> H^(2p)(X,Q))
H_Hodge(X,p) = H^(2p)(X,Q) ∩ H^(p,p)(X)
```

The research goal is to understand and attack the equality

```text
A_alg(X,p) = H_Hodge(X,p).
```

## Current operational frontier

```text
known algebraic cycles
-> exact cycle classes
-> exact span / lattice information
-> rational Hodge target
-> optional certified symmetry decomposition
-> verified missing sector
-> targeted algebraic construction
-> independent check
-> claim ceiling
```

The working hypothesis is methodological: P-vs-NP-style range avoidance, symmetry-promise checks, sharing-aware rank accounting, and counterprobe discipline may make the cycle-discovery search more discriminating. This is not a reduction between the two open problems.

## Calibration ladder

```text
P^2
-> P^1 x P^1
-> abelian surface
-> Kummer K3
-> Fermat quartic K3
-> smooth cubic fourfold calibration
-> selected unresolved families/codimensions
```

## Hard boundaries

```text
CALIBRATION_RESULT != OPEN_PROBLEM_RESULT
FINITE_VERIFICATION != UNIVERSALITY
SAME_HODGE_DIAMOND != SAME_ALGEBRAIC_CYCLE_STRUCTURE
CYCLE_COUNT != CYCLE_CLASS_RANK
SYMMETRY != USEFUL_QUOTIENT
COMPLEX_(p,p) != RATIONAL_HODGE_CLASS
CONSCIENCE64_RETRIEVAL != INDEPENDENT_EVIDENCE
```

## Conformance substrate

The frozen `E001`–`E010` suite lives under [`conformance/`](conformance/). Its first recorded run passes all ten experiments, including deliberate authority-leak, BRL-identity, lattice-corruption, visualization-identity, incomplete-correspondence, crash-overlay, merge-conflict, and parser-ambiguity mutants.

This is research-environment evidence only:

```text
SOFTWARE_PASS != MATHEMATICAL_PROOF
VISUALIZATION != EVIDENCE_PROMOTION
SIMILARITY != SOURCE_IDENTITY
```

## Claim ceiling

The Hodge conjecture is not established by the current project. The directory is a research framework, evidence ledger, calibration suite, and targeted search program.

## Current W114 bounded composition checkpoint

[2026-09-30 signed composition audit](W114_SIGNED_COMPOSITION_AUDIT_2026-09-30.md)
reconciles the later n=3 projective closure and constructs a typed D2 product
transfer with full quotient normalizations. It preserves failed counterprobes
and separates that nonzero transfer block from the unconstructed W114 plane
push and residual-to-Artin cycle. **MOT-1 REMAINS OPEN.**

[Explicit standard-divisor continuation](W114_STANDARD_DIVISOR_CONSTRUCTION_2026-09-30.md)
constructs the four required level-57 standard divisors and a nonzero joined
padding cycle, with exact Kummer actions and inverse normalizations checked by
two intersection calculations. The exceptional Aoki arrow remains open.

[Primitive join composition](W114_STANDARD_JOIN_COMPOSITION_2026-09-30.md)
then constructs the standard residual-to-Aoki correspondence through the common
Fermat carrier, with source, target, variance, boundary vanishing and inverse
scalars traced in Chow. **MOT-1 REMAINS OPEN** at the exceptional quadratic arrow.

[Full level-114 standard reduction](W114_FULL_STANDARD_REDUCTION_2026-09-30.md)
composes the signed duplication/reflection word via explicit duplication divisors,
the degree-32 plane pullback, descended Artin paddings and their normalized joins.
It produces the nonzero W114-to-Aoki standard reduction with both inverses.

[Aoki tensor-square continuation](W114_AOKI_TENSOR_SQUARE_2026-09-30.md)
constructs a separate nonzero square correspondence using the p=19 standard
complete intersection. The remaining residual line has tensor order at most two;
its identification with the corrected quadratic Artin carrier and the unsquared
W114 plane push are still open. Theorem-use is not independent reproof.
